<h2>A brief summary of Bhagat Singh </h2>
<h3>Early life</h3>
<p>
    Bhagat Singh was born on 27 September 1907 in the village of Banga in the Lyallpur district of the Punjab in what was then British India and is today Pakistan, he was the second 
    of seven children four sons, and three daughters born to Vidyavati and her husband Kishan Singh Sandhu Bhagat Singh's father and his uncle Ajit Singh were active in progressive politics,
     taking part in the agitation around the Canal Colonization Bill in 1907.
</p>
<h4>Revolutionary activities</h4>
<h3>Killing of John Saunders</h3>
<p>
    In 1928, the British government set up the Simon Commission to report on the political situation in India. Some Indian political parties boycotted the Commission because there were no Indians in its membership and 
    there were protests across the country. When the Commission visited Lahore on 30 October 1928, Lala Lajpat Rai led a march in protest against it. Police attempts to disperse the large crowd resulted in violence.
     The superintendent of police, James A. Scott, ordered the police to lathi charge (use batons against) the protesters and personally assaulted Rai, who was injured. Rai died of a heart attack on 17 November 1928. 
     Doctors thought that his death might have been hastened by the injuries he had received. When the matter was raised in the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the British Government denied any role in Rai's death.
</p>
<h3>Escape from Lahore</h3>
<p>
    Bhagat Singh and Rajguru, both carrying loaded revolvers, left the house early the next day. Dressed in western attire (Bhagat Singh cut his hair, shaved his beard and wore a hat over cropped hair),
     and carrying Devi's sleeping child, Singh and Devi passed as a young couple, while Rajguru carried their luggage as their servant. At the station, Singh managed to conceal his identity while buying tickets,
      and the three boarded the train heading to Cawnpore (now Kanpur). There they boarded a train for Lucknow since the CID at Howrah railway station usually scrutinised passengers on the direct train from Lahore.

</p>
<h3>Execution</h3>
<p>
    Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev were sentenced to death in the Lahore conspiracy case and ordered to be hanged on 24 March 1931.The schedule was moved forward by 11 hours and the three were hanged on 23 March 1931 
    at 7:30 pm in the Lahore jail. It is reported that no magistrate at the time was willing to supervise Singh's hanging as was required by law. The execution was supervised instead by an honorary judge, who also 
    signed the three death warrants, as their original warrants had expired.The jail authorities then broke a hole in the rear wall of the jail, removed the bodies, and secretly cremated the three men under cover of
     darkness outside Ganda Singh Wala village, and then threw the ashes into the Sutlej river, about 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) from Ferozepore 
</p>
<h3>Popularity</h3>
<p>
    Subhas Chandra Bose said that: "Bhagat Singh had become the symbol of the new awakening among the youths." Nehru acknowledged that Bhagat Singh's popularity was leading to a new national awakening, saying: "He was 
    a clean fighter who faced his enemy in the open field ... he was like a spark that became a flame in a short time and spread from one end of the country to the other dispelling the prevailing darkness everywhere. 
    Four years after Singh's hanging, the Director of the Intelligence Bureau, Sir Horace Williamson, wrote: "His photograph was on sale in every city and township and for a time rivaled in popularity even that of Mr.Gandhi himself.
</p>
<h3>Legacy</h3>
Bhagat Singh remains a significant figure in Indian iconography to the present day His memory, however, defies categorisation and presents problems for various groups that might try to appropriate it. Pritam Singh, a
 professor who has specialised in the study of federalism, nationalism and development in India
